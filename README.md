Travel booking website SPA built on the MEAN stack.

---

### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

This project was built using the MEAN stack. The MEAN stack provides the benefit of only using one language (JavaScript) to build every aspect of the application. The rest of the&nbsp;stack includes Express, a framework that makes creating APIs much more time-efficient. Node.js is a runtime environment that handles the server side of the application.&nbsp;
The front-end web page was built on Express, while the logged-in back-end is built using Angular, a JS framework for building single-page applications (SPAs). The beauty of the SPA is the increased responsiveness since the content is dynamically loaded on the client side.

### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

MongoDB was a good choice for this application because it uses the same formatting as JSON, and works well with JavaScript.

---

### How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is a formatting standard for storing data, whereas JavaScript is an object oriented programming language. JSON ties together the front and backend by passing data to and fromeach end via HTTP requests.

### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

When building the client side, there was a lot of redundant code between several web pages. To remedy the redundancy, handlebars were used to create sections that were then inserted onto the
necessary pages.

### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full-stack application.

To test the API I used the Postman tool to get and post to each endpoint. Postman made testing simpler, but it was certainly a tedious task. Debugging was primarily done using information&nbsp;from the console log, and the browser developer tools. With the console and developer tools, I was able to get critical feedback as to what was breaking the application.&nbsp;

### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has been fantastic. From building an entire web application to learning new tools, the experience I have gained from this course has given me a deeper understanding of web applications and the methods used for creating them.&nbsp;
